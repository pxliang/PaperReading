This paper is actually an old paper and is a very classic paper. I have been read it before, but even now I read it again,
I still can learn something that I missed before.

My target today is mainly to learn the loss and RoI operations.

Take away from each part:
1. Introduction:
   a. Faster RCNN is the first to propose region proposal network (RPN) and the anchor. The role of RPN is to simultaneously
    regree bounding box and objectness scores;
   b. The RPN and detection network are not trained end-to-end in the Faster RCNN.
